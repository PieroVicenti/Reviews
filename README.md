## Reviews

https://pierovicenti.github.io/Reviews/

Project purely created with the aim of exploring more React features and functionalities, not forgetting about the style (icons have been imported from the React-icons library).

This project shows a number of reviews, showing some of the reviewers' details too (Picture and name).

I have simply played with the buttons' functionalities, there three buttons and one of them allows the user to see a random review every time the button is clicked.

A simple project that can be considered for review implementation in other bigger projects.
